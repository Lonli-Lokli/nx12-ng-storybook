# c-design-patterns

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Storybook

To build and serve the storybook application:

`nx run c-design-patterns:storybook`

Accessible from http://localhost:4400

You can also generate a static site version of the storybook app:

`nx run c-design-patterns:generate-storybook-static-site`

This will generate the assets into the `dist/storybook/c-design-patterns` directory

This is useful if you want to host the storybook application elsewhere, and need a built site ready to copy to another location for serving from.


## Running unit tests

Run `nx test c-design-patterns` to execute the unit tests.
